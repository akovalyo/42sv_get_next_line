### Summury:

The aim of this project is to make you code a function that returns a line ending with a newline, read from a file descriptor.

### Tips:

* Pointers!
* Why we use pointer to pointer? 

>       When we want to change the value of the pointer passed to another function 
>       and preserve it after the function is done we can use pointer to a pointer.
